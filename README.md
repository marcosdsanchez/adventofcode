Solutions to http://adventofcode.com/

Solutions in [crystal](http://crystal-lang.org) should not be taken as reference
to learn the language. All the algorithms should work, but this is just my
attempt to learn a new language, so the code is not the best.

If you want to learn the language, I recommend taking a look at
[asterite's repository](http://github.com/asterite/adventofcode) that contains
solutions for the same problems but written in a much better way.
